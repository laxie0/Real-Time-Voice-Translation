# Real-Time-Voice-Translation
A real-time voice translation application built using Python, Speech Recognition, Deep Translator, and gTTS. It captures speech from the microphone, converts it into text, translates it into the selected language, and plays the translated audio instantly. A simple Tkinter GUI makes it easy to use for multilingual communication.
